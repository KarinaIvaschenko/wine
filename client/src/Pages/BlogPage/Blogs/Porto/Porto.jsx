        Porto is a major city located in the northwest of Portugal, situated on the banks of the Douro River. This city
        is renowned for its rich history, cultural heritage, and, of course, its winemaking tradition. One of
        Porto&apos;s distinctive features in the realm of winemaking is the production of port wine.

      <p className="blog__text">
        Port wine is a fortified wine with a high alcohol content that is produced in the Douro region and its
        surrounding areas. This type of wine got its name from the Portuguese city of Porto. It&apos;s important to note
        that the term &apos;port wine&apos; can only be used for wines produced in this region; wines of similar styles
        produced elsewhere are typically referred to as &apos;fortified wine.&apos;
